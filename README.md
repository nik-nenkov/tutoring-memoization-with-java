# Black-and-White Board Challenge

## Introduction
This repository contains a solution to a combinatorial puzzle: arranging black and white squares on an N x M board. The goal is to determine the number of possible arrangements where no two neighboring squares are black.

## Problem Statement
- **Task**: Count the different ways to arrange black and white squares on an N x M board.
- **Constraint**: No two adjacent squares can be black.

## Inspiration
The solution employs dynamic programming concepts, which may be related to the principles discussed in this [Dynamic Programming YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hdr64lKQ3e4).

## Usage
- Clone the repository to access the solution.
- Review the code to understand the dynamic programming approach used.
